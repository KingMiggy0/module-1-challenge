# Web Design Basics: Things I Learned

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Miguel Pena. This repository showcases the fundamental skills and concepts I have learned in web design. These skills were acquired from various resources, including MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and articles from my web development boot camp.

## Things I Learned

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the backbone of any web page, providing its structure and content.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Elements and Tags:** I learned how to use HTML tags to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
  - **Attributes:** I discovered how to add attributes to HTML elements to provide additional information, like `class`, `id`, and `href`.
  - **Forms and Inputs:** I explored creating forms with various input types for user interaction.
  - **Semantic HTML:** I learned the importance of using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` for better accessibility and SEO.

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style and layout web pages, making them visually appealing.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Selectors:** I learned how to use different types of selectors (e.g., class, id, and element selectors) to target HTML elements.
  - **Properties and Values:** I explored various CSS properties and how to assign values to them to style elements.
  - **The Box Model:** I understood the box model concept, including content, padding, border, and margin.
  - **Flexbox and Grid Layouts:** I practiced using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts.
  - **Responsive Design:** I learned techniques to ensure web pages look good on all devices using media queries and responsive units.

### 3. JavaScript
JavaScript allows for dynamic and interactive web pages.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Variables and Data Types:** I learned how to declare variables and understand different data types.
  - **Functions:** I practiced writing functions to encapsulate reusable code.

### 4. Cascade and Inheritance in CSS
Understanding how CSS rules are applied and inherited was crucial for writing effective styles.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Specificity:** I learned how specificity determines which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target the same element.
  - **Inheritance:** I explored how certain CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements.
  - **The Cascade:** I understood the order of precedence in CSS rules and how the cascade affects style application.
  - **Importance:** I discovered the use of `!important` to override other CSS rules, though it should be used sparingly.
